// Vectors in C++ are much alike vectors in math - they're infinite(only limited by RAM) indexed arrays.

// This algorithm goes the opposite way - instead of finding a number's divisors, we're searching their multipliers
// and then we're counting the multipliers(as divisors). This algorithm saves a lot of time and resources. Dividing every
// single number and then checking if its an integer would take up to 50% more resources(time, RAM).

// The nested loops go through all pairs(i, n) where i*n < 10 000 000, incrementing divisors[i*q].
